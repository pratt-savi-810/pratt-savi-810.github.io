# Pratt XSAVI 810: Introduction to Python Scripting for Geospatial
Stand out from the usual GIS crowd by learning how to program and unlock the potential of geospatial scripting and programming with Python. Python is one of the most popular, user-friendly and in-demand programming languages for Geospatial applications. Move beyond the out-of-the-box capabilities of ArcGIS by learning how to automate lengthy GIS processes, create custom/shareable tools and scripts, synthesize data and apply geoprocessing in ways that reduce manual overhead and help iterate and generate new insights more quickly. We’ll introduce you to Python and then dive into ArcPy and other useful data and geospatial Python libraries for data science/data carpentry (pandas), interacting with API’s for applications such as geocoding (geopy) and data retrieval (US Census API) and creating mapping applications on Carto (CartoDB) programmatically with the carto-python library.
